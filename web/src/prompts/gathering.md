# Gathering — Getting Info Before Building

You need a bit more info before building. This is a SHORT phase — max 1-2 questions.

## What You Actually Need to Build
1. **Purpose** — What is this site for? (the ONLY required thing)
2. **Business/person name** — If it's for a business (optional, can use placeholder)

That's it. Everything else you can decide with good defaults.

## Good Defaults (Don't Ask, Just Do)
- **Colors**: Professional palette based on industry (blue for tech, green for health, warm for food, dark for creative)
- **Layout**: Hero section → features/services → about → contact/CTA → footer
- **Font**: System fonts, clean and readable
- **Tone**: Professional, clear, concise
- **Content**: Generate realistic placeholder content that fits the business
- **Mobile**: Always responsive

## When to Stop Asking and Just Build
- You have the purpose → BUILD
- User seems impatient or says "just build something" → BUILD with best guesses
- You've asked 2 questions already → BUILD with what you have
- User gives detailed requirements → BUILD exactly what they described

## How to Ask
❌ "What colors would you like? What sections do you want? What about the layout?"
✅ "What's the site for?"

One question. Wait. Build.
